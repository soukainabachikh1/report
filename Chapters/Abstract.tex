This report presents the work carried out during my end-of-studies internship at 4D Software Morocco, focused on the design and development of a recruitment management platform. 
The main objective of this project is to simplify and 
automate the recruitment process, thereby reducing processing 
times and efforts by recruiters. This will be achieved by 
integrating principal features, including job offer management, automatic CV sorting, candidate skill evaluation through assessment tests, and interview scheduling into a single coherent system.
\newline

The agile methodology was adopted, involving rapid iterations and continuous adjustments based on needs, due to the absence of a well-defined specifications document. To successfully execute this project, several steps were followed. Initially, an analysis of the existing system was conducted to identify flaws in the current process. Next, user needs for each module were analyzed and modeled using mockups and various UML and BPMN diagrams. Finally, development of each module's functionalities commenced, primarily utilizing 4D for the backend and React for the frontend.
